### map-pseudo-classes
*Using JS map() to implement CSS psuedo-classes*

---

These examples demonstrate how to simulate psuedo-classes with `map()`.

Using React.js, it's become popular to use inline-styles. In the examples directory are a few components that demonstrate how you might reproduce the affects of some `pseude-classes` without CSS.

### Examples

* [:first-child](https://github.com/chantastic/map-pseudo-classes/blob/master/examples/FirstChild.js#L7)
* [:last-child](https://github.com/chantastic/map-pseudo-classes/blob/master/examples/LastChild.js#L7)
* [:only-child](https://github.com/chantastic/map-pseudo-classes/blob/master/examples/OnlyChild.js#L7)
* [:nth-child(n)](https://github.com/chantastic/map-pseudo-classes/blob/master/examples/NthChildN.js#L13)
* [:nth-child(odd)](https://github.com/chantastic/map-pseudo-classes/blob/master/examples/NthChildOdd.js#L7)
* [:nth-child(even)](https://github.com/chantastic/map-pseudo-classes/blob/master/examples/NthChildEven.js#L7)

### Anti-usage

These components are worthless. Don't use them as components. Just steal the bits expressions.
